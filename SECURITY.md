## 🛡️ Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover any potential security issue in this project (even if minor), please report it **privately** so it can be addressed responsibly.

### How to report:
- Open an issue **without sharing sensitive info**, and mention it's security-related.
- Or, contact me directly on Discord: `xalperen`
- Or, open a GitHub Discussion if it's more of a question than a vulnerability.

Please **do not abuse or exploit** any issue you find.
